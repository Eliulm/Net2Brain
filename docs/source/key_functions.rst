Key Functions
=============

The Net2Brain toolbox encompasses several key functions to support comprehensive neural research:

1. **Model Taxonomy**
2. **Loading built-in datasets**
3. **Feature Extraction**
4. **Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs)**
5. **Evaluation** and **Plotting**

Each of these key functions is crucial for conducting advanced neural research and provides users with powerful tools for analysis and visualization. Detailed information on each function can be found on the respective subpages listed below.
