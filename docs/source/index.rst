Welcome to Net2Brain's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to **Net2Brain**, a powerful toolbox designed to facilitate the comparison of human brain activity patterns with the activations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). 
With over 600 pre-trained DNNs available, Net2Brain empowers neuroscientists to explore and analyze the relationships between artificial and biological neural representations.

Net2Brain is a collaborative effort between CVAI and Radek Cichy's lab, aimed at providing a user-friendly toolbox for neural research with deep neural networks.
