Welcome to Net2Brain's Documentation!
=====================================

Welcome to **Net2Brain**, a powerful toolbox designed to bridge the gap between human brain activity patterns and the activations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Boasting a library of over 600 pre-trained DNNs, Net2Brain offers neuroscientists an expansive platform to investigate and compare artificial and biological neural representations.

Developed through a partnership between CVAI and Radek Cichy's lab, Net2Brain is dedicated to enhancing the field of neural research by providing a user-friendly interface for engaging with deep neural networks.

To get started with the project, see the :ref:`installation` guide.
